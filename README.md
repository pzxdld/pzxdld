- 👋 Hi, I’m @pzxdld. This was my really old network login id and I got used to it. :D
- 👀 I’m interested in learning. I love to code, read, play guitar, code, and code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git. LOL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ???. TBH my best contribution with my current technical skills would be to write or proofread documentation.
- 📫 How to reach me: @BobLWebDesign on Twitter.
